                <h3>making hollowblocks out of carabao manure & waste paper & shells</h3>
                <p>this was the craziest thing i have ever done for a grade ðŸ˜­</p>
                <p>so in this project, we utilized dried carabao dung, waste papers and then shells gathered from locals in the city. we put the dung in a container and put a lot of water in that container (add an emphasis on 'a lot') and then we mixed it.</p>
                <p>we then ripped the waste papers. we also cooked the shells first, cooked it, and get the insides of the shells out. we then smash the shells with a hammer.</p>
                <p>and then we mixed those 3 things together and we dried it in the sun. (good thing that there was a heat index during that project, so it really helped with drying the bricks)</p>
